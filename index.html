        <p>
        Drag the slider for rough approximation of daily covid case activity
        as a proportion of population at the county level. Data is a bit patchy
        and the implementation is a bit wonky; this is not for research purposes,
        but gives an overall impression of distribution of activity. The suddenly
        bright red areas indicate a somewhat arbitrary cap in measuring the
        relative activity: as confusingly as possible, the top 3ish percent of
        daily cases as measured against population ramp up exponetially, so I
        capped it somewhere in the middle of that rise and it kinda sorta maybe
        represents an outbreak if the patch persists. Some sudden statewide
        spikes are reporting anamolies, often a change in how cases are recorded.
        The blank spot that never shows a case in South Dakota is the western
        half of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. I don't know why there's no
        data for it in the
        <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data" target="_angry">NYT information</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The "Lag" control sets the number of layers. If it's more than one,
        it will update transparent layers sequentially, creating a sort of trailing
        average effect. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Mask usage is based on a single, recent data collection, so does not change
        over time.
